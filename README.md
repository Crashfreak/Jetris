Jetris
======

A small Tetris clone I built in around 2001 for fun during a one week break I had.

To Play you need Java installed.<br/>
To Compile:<br/>
```java javac *java```<br/>
To Run<br/>
```java java Jetris```

The graphics are weird and it is not complete. The gameplay is fairly complete, however things like highscores or any of the menu options are just not there.
